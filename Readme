# 2D Scrolling Shooter Game
```
This project is to develop an AI agent that is able to survive and perform well in 
the 2D scrolling shooter game. The enemies are constantly roaming, and the agent should 
shoot, avoid bullets, avoid obstacles and decide in real time. The agent should learn 
perfectly from your own gaming experience, without providing specific instructions or 
hard -coded rules.
